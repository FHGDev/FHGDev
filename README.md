# Hi there! Welcome to my profile! Here's a few things about me.
- I love programming. I've been programming in JavaScript since I was 12.
- I love animals. I don't know why, but I just have this deep seated love of horses, cats, dogs, goats... Pretty much any animal that won't kill me.
- I own a Discord bot list called [BoatSpace](https://boatspace.xyz/). I started work on it in September of 2020. It's probably the project of mine I'm proudest of.
- I own a Discord bot named [Hulkbot](https://boatspace.xyz/bots/294194506113220608)
