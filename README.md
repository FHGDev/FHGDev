Heyo! I see you've discovered my profile. :eyes:

# About Me
I'm a rocker by nature. I like bands like Breaking Benjamin, Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, Five Finger Death Punch, etc. Check out my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/9zqbd3u89wsns30n8crhgb3se).  
I've been programming in JavaScript since I was 12. It's my passion, and I plan to make a career from it. 
I'm also [certified](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xxDL-lONBT2kEuhwBOVFGdAXyRyQVg_O/view?usp=sharing) in Adobe Photoshop CC 2018! I got this certification at 16 years old, and I am quite proficient in both [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) & [GIMP](https://gimp.org).

# Projects
I own a E-Publishing website called [Scrawlr](https://scrawlr.xyz). I created it to give aspiring writers a place to show off their work online. It is in closed alpha, and I plan to release it in summer of 2021.  
I own a not-so-popular Discord bot list called [BoatSpace](https://boatspace.xyz). It's in open beta right now, and it has 25 registered bots as of yet.  
I also own a Discord bot called Hulkbot that I am currently working on rewriting to fit the standards of [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) v12.  
I own a Discord radio bot called Rock FM. As you can probably tell from the name, the music played through it is catered to lovers of rock music. It is in open alpha, and has 10 servers.
